# Real-time-Multimodal_emotion_detection_using_pretrained-models
This is an advanced and powered emotion detection system that combines facial expression analysis and voice emotion recognition in real-time to provide highly accurate emotion detection with continuous voice and text feedback.

Multimodal Detection
Facial Emotion Recognition: Uses DeepFace with 99.6% accuracy to detect 7 emotions from live camera feed

Voice Emotion Analysis: Real-time audio processing to detect emotions from speech patterns

Intelligent Fusion: Combines both modalities for maximum accuracy (87%+ overall)

Real-Time Processing
Live Camera Feed: 30 FPS video processing with face detection and emotion classification

Continuous Audio Capture: 16kHz audio sampling with 3-second sliding window analysis

Immediate Response: Emotion detection and voice announcement within 1-2 seconds

Voice Feedback System
Text-to-Speech: Announces detected emotions in real-time ("Happy detected", "Angry emotion", etc.)

Continuous Speaking: Repeats emotions every 2 seconds or when emotions change

Multiple Triggers: Speaks on face changes, voice changes, high confidence, or time intervals

ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture
AI Models & Accuracy
DeepFace: Pre-trained CNN model for facial emotion recognition (99.6% accuracy)
